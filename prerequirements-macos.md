# Prerequirements for macOS Users

The easiest way of installing the development environment on Mac is using
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Open up the Terminal and install Homebrew by
following the instructions on the main page of their website.

## Ruby

macOS comes with Ruby pre-installed although you may need to update it if you
are using an older OS version.

Check the installed version:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -v
```

If you have version 2.4 or above you're fine.

Use the following command to install Ruby if you have an older version
installed:

```bash
brew install ruby
```

## Visual Studio Code

Go to [VS Code's website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and click on the
"Download for Mac" button.

Extract the downloaded zip file and copy `Visual Studio Code.app` to
`Applications`.

## Google Chrome

Go to the [Google Chrome's website](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and hit
"Download Chrome".

Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag & drop Chrome to the Applications
folder.

## Git
